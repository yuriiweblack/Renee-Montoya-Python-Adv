1. Create flask app with docker-compose.
2. Write calculator with html template (something like we did on our lecture)
Route list:
/calc/5/2/div - result on page "5 / 2 = 2.5"
/calc/5/2/sum - result on page "5 + 2 = 7"
/calc/5/2/dif - result on page "5 - 2 = 3"
/calc/5/2/mult - result on page "5 * 2 = 10"
